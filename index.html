      <p> I have a very unique style, I am honestly still not sure what to call it but its something you will not find elsewhere.
        I love cooler tones and blues, I prefer to think my tones reflect an 80's style! I fell in love with photography when I was
        15, I ran around taking photos on my phone and the love and passion for creating art grew from there. As time went along I
        noticed I had a nack for it and moved into graphic design as well. From there I followed my heart and continued creating in any way
        I could. So please, feel free to take a look at my gallery and find out of I would be the right fit for what you are looking for. And I promise

        and a pleasent expierence.I have plenty of expierence working with and for people with a friendly and happy demeanor. I find it
        to be pivotal to taylor a custom expierence in which you will never forget. Come book with me today! </p>
